# Bitmaker Labs Assignment 1

Welcome to BitMakerLabs today you'll be introduced to the Swift Programming Language.
 The first thing we'll look at is a variable.
 Variables can be defined as a container that stores information
 In the example below we have a variable that stores a string
 Creating a variable starts by using the keyword **var** next you define the name of the variable **str** the **=** is an assignment operator this tells the compiler that the value to the right of the **=** will now be stored in variable **str**
*/
var str = "Hello, playground"
/*:

## Challenge 1: Create a variable that stores your first and last name
Note: **var** defines that your creating a variable
**myName** defines the name of the varaible
**=** defines an assignment operator
**"MyName"** is the string value that you will store

*/
// Type code here !!!


/*:
Congratulations on creating your first variable. There's many different variables that you can create. An important concept that we must discuss is types. **Types** define the values that can be stored in a variable. A list of the most common value types that you can work with are as follows.

**Bool** defines true or false values
**Int** defines whole numbers example 12 or 234
**Float** defines defines floating point values 12.5 or 234.567
**String** defines a series of characters "Kwame Bryan"

Types can also be Objects. More on that later. In our last example, we let the compiler decide the types we were working with. We can also be explicit about our data types.

To be explicit we will create our variables a bit differently as an example we would create our variables like the following.               
    **var myFloatingPointValue:Float = 234.56**

## Challenge two: Create 4 Variables that store a Boolean Value / an Integer Value / a Floating Point Value / and a String Value

/*:
We've talked about variables and their uses. In some cases you'll not want a variable to be changed in these cases you will want to use the keyword **let** which will create a constant or sometimes referred to as a immutable type. An example of an immutable type is as follows

**let variableThatShouldChange:String = "SomeString"**.

The main thing you should take away, is that if you want a variable that is **mutable** or can change use a **var** if you want a variable that is constant or **immutable** use **let**

## Challenge 3

Now, you have a try at this. Create a variable that is constant. Also, try and assign a value to that variable after you have declared it. What type of error do you recieve.

## Operators

Now, we'll look at operators. You first learned about operators in elementary school math class. **+** to add **-** to subtract ***** to multiply **'/'** to divide and **=** to assign a value. These all exist in Swift and with a few extra's that we'll get to later. Type the following and see the response.

[Helpful resourses of Operator should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html)

* var a = 10
* a = a + 1
* a = a - 1
* a = a * a

*/
// Type code here !!!


/*:

In the results pane, you'll see 10, 11, 10 and 100 respectively. Now try this:

* var b = 10
* b += 10
* b -= 10

*/
// Type code here !!!


/*:
**+=** is an operator that means "add then assign to." In our case it means "take the current value of b, add 10 to it, then put the result back into b." As you might imagine, **-=** does the same but subtracts rather then adds. So, that code will show 10, 20, 10 in the results pane.

If you want to add or subtract 1 from a number, there are special operators just for that. These are **++** and **--**, used like this: Type the following into your playground to see the result.

* var b = 10
* ++b
* --b

*/
// Type code here !!!



/*:
## Comparison operators

Swift has a set of operators that perform comparisons on values. 
 
greater than **(>)** , greater than or equal **(>=)** , and less than **(<)**  less than or equal **(<=)**.

If you want to check for equality, you can't use = because already has a meaning: it's used to give a variable a value. So, Swift has an alternative in the form of ==, meaning "is equal to." For example:
Type the following into playground and see the result.

* var a = 1.1
* var b = 2.2
* var c = a + b

* c > 3
* c >= 3
* c > 4
* c < 4

/*:
## String interpolation

This is a fancy name for what is actually a very simple thing: combining variables and constants inside a string.

* var name = "Your Name"
If we wanted to print out a message to the user that included their name, string interpolation is what makes that easy: you just write a backslash, then an open parenthesis, then your code, then a close parenthesis, like this:

* var name = "Your Name"
* "Your name is \(name)"

The results pane will now show "Your name is Your Name" all as one string, because string interpolation combined the two for us.

Now, we could have written that using the + operator, like this:

var name = "Your Name"
"Your name is " + name

â€¦but that's not as efficient, particularly if you're combining multiple variables together. In addition, string interpolation in Swift is smart enough to be able to handle a variety of different data types automatically. For example:

* var name = "Your Name"
* var age = 25
* var latitude = 36.166667

"Your name is \(name), your age is \(age), and your latitude is \(latitude)"

[Helpful resourses on String and Characters should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html)

## Challenge 3
* Create a variable of type string for your name 
* Create a variable of type int for your age
* using string interpolation print both of these in the same line.

/*:

## Arrays

Arrays let you group lots of values together into a single collection, then access those values by their position in the collection. Swift uses type inference to figure out what type of data your array holds, like so:

* var evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
* var favoriteGames = ["Super Meat Boy", "Metroid", "Legend of Zelda", "Super Mario"]

[Helpful resourses on Collection Types should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html)

Have a go. Create an Array that stores the names of your family members.
*/
// Type code here !!!

/*:

Swift uses brackets to mark the start and end of an array, and each item in the array is separated with a comma.

When it comes to reading items out an array, there's a catch: Swift starts counting at 0. 

This means the first item is 0, the second item is 1, the third is 2, and so on. 
So as an example this would look like the following.

* var favoriteGames = ["Super Meat Boy", "Metroid", "Legend of Zelda", "Super Mario"]
* favoriteGames[0]
* favoriteGames[1]
* favoriteGames[2]

*/
// Type code here !!!

/*:

## Creating arrays

If you make an array using the syntax shown above, Swift creates the array and fills it with the values we specified. Things aren't quite so straightforward if you want to create the array then fill it later â€“ this syntax doesn't work:

* var game: [String]
* game[0] = "Fly or Die"

Have a good and try this code in Playgrounds **NOTE** remember to delete this code after this is only to show the error.
*/
// Type code here !!!

/*:

Put simply, writing var game: [String] tells Swift "the game variable will hold an array of strings," 
but it doesn't actually create that array. It doesn't allocate any memory, or do any of the work to actually create
a Swift array. It just says that at some point there will be an array, and it will hold strings.

There are a few ways to express this correctly, and the one that probably makes most sense at this time is this:

* var game: [String] = []

Have a go. Try this in your playground and notice an empty collection.

*/
// Type code here !!!

/*:
## Array Operators

You can use a limited set of operators on arrays. For example, you can merge two arrays by using the + operator, like this:

* var gameList1 = ["Doom", "Braid", "Grand Theft Auto 1969"]
* var gameList2 = ["Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze", "Roblox", "NHL 2005"]
* var bothGameLists = gameList1 + gameList2

You can also use += to add and assign, like this:

bothGameLists += ["Grand Theft Auto 5"]

Have a go. Create two distinct arrays in of Type string. The data can be anything you want. e.i favorite books / songs / recipes. Combine the two using **+** and store the results in a new **array**

/*:
## Dictionaries

Swift arrays are a collection where you access each item using a numerical index, such as songs[0]. 
Dictionaries are another common type of collection, but they differ from arrays because they let you access values based on a key you specify.

[Helpful resourses on Dictionaries should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID113)

To give you an example, let's imagine how we might store data about a person in an array:

* var person = ["Kwame", "Charlton", "Bryan", "June", "3einteractive.com"]

To read out that person's middle name, we'd use person[1], and to read out the month they were born we'd use person[3]. This has a few problems, not least that it's difficult to remember what index number is assigned to each value in the array! And what happens if the person has no middle name? Chances are all the other values would move down one place, causing chaos in your code.

With dictionaries we can re-write this to be far more sensible, because rather than arbitrary numbers you get to read and write values using a key you specify. For example:

* var person = ["first": "Kwame", "middle": "Charlton", "last": "Bryan", "month": "June", "website": "3einteractive.com"]
* person["middle"]
* person["month"]

It might help if I use lots of whitespace to break up the dictionary on your screen, like this:

* var person = [
* "first": "Kwame",
* "middle": "Charlton",
* "last": "Bryan",
* "month": "June",
* "website": "3einteractive.com"
* ]

* person["middle"]
* person["month"]

As you can see, when you make a dictionary you write its key, then a colon, then its value. You can then read any value from the dictionary just by knowing its key, which is much easier to work with.

As with arrays, you can store a wide variety of values inside dictionaries, although the keys are most commonly strings.

Have a go. Create a Dictionary with your first / middle / last names the month you were born and your website. If you don't have a website just make one up.
