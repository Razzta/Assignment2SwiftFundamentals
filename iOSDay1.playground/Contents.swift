# Bitmaker Labs Assignment 1

Welcome to BitMakerLabs today you'll be introduced to the Swift Programming Language.
 The first thing we'll look at is a variable.
 Variables can be defined as a container that stores information
 In the example below we have a variable that stores a string
 Creating a variable starts by using the keyword **var** next you define the name of the variable **str** the **=** is an assignment operator this tells the compiler that the value to the right of the **=** will now be stored in variable **str**
*/
var str = "Hello, playground"
/*:

## Challenge 1: Create a variable that stores your first and last name
Note: **var** defines that your creating a variable
**myName** defines the name of the varaible
**=** defines an assignment operator
**"MyName"** is the string value that you will store

*/

/*:
Congratulations on creating your first variable. There's many different variables that you can create. An important concept that we must discuss is types. **Types** define the values that can be stored in a variable. A list of the most common value types that you can work with are as follows.

**Bool** defines true or false values
**Int** defines whole numbers example 12 or 234
**Float** defines defines floating point values 12.5 or 234.567
**String** defines a series of characters "Kwame Bryan"

Types can also be Objects. More on that later. In our last example, we let the compiler decide the types we were working with. We can also be explicit about our data types.

To be explicit we will create our variables a bit differently as an example we would create our variables like the following.               
    **var myFloatingPointValue:Float = 234.56**

## Challenge two: Create 4 Variables that store a Boolean Value / an Integer Value / a Floating Point Value / and a String Value

/*:
We've talked about variables and their uses. In some cases you'll not want a variable to be changed in these cases you will want to use the keyword **let** which will create a constant or sometimes referred to as a immutable type. An example of an immutable type is as follows

**let variableThatShouldChange:String = "SomeString"**.

The main thing you should take away, is that if you want a variable that is **mutable** or can change use a **var** if you want a variable that is constant or **immutable** use **let**

## Challenge 3

Now, you have a try at this. Create a variable that is constant. Also, try and assign a value to that variable after you have declared it. What type of error do you recieve.

## Operators

Now, we'll look at operators. You first learned about operators in elementary school math class. **+** to add **-** to subtract ***** to multiply **'/'** to divide and **=** to assign a value. These all exist in Swift and with a few extra's that we'll get to later. Type the following and see the response.

[Helpful resourses of Operator should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html)

* var a = 10
* a = a + 1
* a = a - 1
* a = a * a

*/
// Type code here !!!


/*:

In the results pane, you'll see 10, 11, 10 and 100 respectively. Now try this:

* var b = 10
* b += 10
* b -= 10

*/
// Type code here !!!


/*:
**+=** is an operator that means "add then assign to." In our case it means "take the current value of b, add 10 to it, then put the result back into b." As you might imagine, **-=** does the same but subtracts rather then adds. So, that code will show 10, 20, 10 in the results pane.

If you want to add or subtract 1 from a number, there are special operators just for that. These are **++** and **--**, used like this: Type the following into your playground to see the result.

* var b = 10
* ++b
* --b

*/
// Type code here !!!



/*:
## Comparison operators

Swift has a set of operators that perform comparisons on values. 
 
greater than **(>)** , greater than or equal **(>=)** , and less than **(<)**  less than or equal **(<=)**.

If you want to check for equality, you can't use = because already has a meaning: it's used to give a variable a value. So, Swift has an alternative in the form of ==, meaning "is equal to." For example:
Type the following into playground and see the result.

* var a = 1.1
* var b = 2.2
* var c = a + b

* c > 3
* c >= 3
* c > 4
* c < 4

/*:
## String interpolation

This is a fancy name for what is actually a very simple thing: combining variables and constants inside a string.

* var name = "Your Name"
If we wanted to print out a message to the user that included their name, string interpolation is what makes that easy: you just write a backslash, then an open parenthesis, then your code, then a close parenthesis, like this:

* var name = "Your Name"
* "Your name is \(name)"

The results pane will now show "Your name is Your Name" all as one string, because string interpolation combined the two for us.

Now, we could have written that using the + operator, like this:

var name = "Your Name"
"Your name is " + name

â€¦but that's not as efficient, particularly if you're combining multiple variables together. In addition, string interpolation in Swift is smart enough to be able to handle a variety of different data types automatically. For example:

* var name = "Your Name"
* var age = 25
* var latitude = 36.166667

"Your name is \(name), your age is \(age), and your latitude is \(latitude)"

[Helpful resourses on String and Characters should be read before continuing.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html)

## Challenge 3
* Create a variable of type string for your name 
* Create a variable of type int for your age
* using string interpolation print both of these in the same line.
